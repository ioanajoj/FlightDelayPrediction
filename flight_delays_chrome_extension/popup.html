    <h1>Flight Delay Prediction</h1>
    <p>Hello there! Thank you for choosing this extension for your post Covid-19 flights!</p>

    <p>The predictions that you see on the skyscanner page are of two types:
        <ul> for those flights scheduled to depart within 15 days from now, real weather forecast is used, so we expect them to be more precise</ul>
        <ul> flights departing later than 15 days from now have predictions based on weather means during the chosen period of time</ul>
    </p>
